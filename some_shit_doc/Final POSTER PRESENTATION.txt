POSTER PRESENTATION- PASTEN IT

Mind is very powerful and knows no limits when it comes to imagination. The creativity in its neurons will have to go through a vigorous challenge. For some, a small white sheet is merely a piece of paper but for others it’s a canvas filled with hidden colors and immense possibilities. 

In this event, we provide a platform to tame your deft ideas and thoughts and reflect them on a seemingly ordinary paper. This is not only about flaunting your imaginary skills but also your inner artist where you are conveying to the world your message through your poster. This poster competition, being held at the ENERGEIA’17 is designed to emphasize the ability of delivering a ‘Visual Presentation’. Subject matter is to be related to an interesting area in the field of energy.
