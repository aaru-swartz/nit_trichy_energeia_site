REAL TIME PROBLEM SOLVING – IMPROMPTU
 
“Invention is the mother of necessity”. The world we know today would not have been the world we know if the world we don’t know had not done what it takes to build the world we know. Be it talking over distances or moving over distances, we manage to make a mechanism to make our lives easier. 
So whenever you find yourself in some unforeseen challenging situations, you improvise and try to make things right. And sometimes those nuanced solutions tend to create new wonders of engineering. 
This event is designed to test your nerves. Working against time, the participants need to showcase their problem solving skills. It’s a battle of Imagination, Creativity and Innovation. 

FORMAT

Round 1: A Problem Statement will be given to the participants related to daily routine or global disputes. The problems can be expected to be from either technical field or common sense based. Each team (with maximum of 2 members) needs to come up with an idea which can be useful in solving or mitigating that problem. 
Your answer must include: 
?	A Title for your solution (Name you would like to give to your invention)
?	Technical aspects
?	Environmental Impacts/ Energy Consumption
?	Estimated Costs
?	Feasibility Score (What you think is its feasibility on a scale of 1-10)
Round 2: A panel of Experts from the field will assess your artistic replies. And if need arises, round 2 will be conducted amongst the top teams as arbitrated by the judges. Time will now play even more crucial role and may become the deciding factor in the outcome.
